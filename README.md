Data Scientist | AI/ML Engineer | Master's Student in Software and Data Engineering

## About Me

I am a Data Scientist and AI/ML Engineer with a strong focus on machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and cybersecurity.  
Currently pursuing my Master's in Software and Data Engineering at Charles University, with an exchange program at the University of Basel.

At Cisco, I have contributed to developing phishing detection systems capable of processing 400 million emails weekly and detecting over 550,000 phishing attempts per week. My work emphasizes building scalable, efficient AI solutions with real-world business impact.

My Master's thesis focuses on fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for phishing detection, optimizing models for efficiency and real-world deployment.
